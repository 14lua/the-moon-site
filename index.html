        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          I'm glad that you are paying a visit to the site.
          This is a site that I created for my projects - sort of like a portfolio.
          Here you'll find a collection of all the things that I am working on,
          which also allows me to draw some lines between them and introduce people interested
          by one of my projects to my other works - but also it gives me an excuse to finally
          work on a personal page.
        </p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Theres a good chance you found this site completely by accident,
          so allow me a few lines to introduce myself to you!<br>
          Online, I go by Lua, but if you care about my real name, it's Luan - creative, i know.
          In my early teens, I found artistry for myself and used it as a medium to let my creative
          mind let off some steam and put my feelings into pretty pictures when they got overwhelming.
          Skip a few years - I finally got my hands on the tools to create music, which has been a long time
          dream of mine by then. By now I have a relased a couple of tracks and working on a bunch more.<br>
          Other than that, I like to code and every once in a while work on something new.
        </p>

        <h2>The point is...</h2>
        <p>
          I see art as a way of connecting people. My motivation to create is equally
          political/philosophical as it is emotional. In the somewhat little time I spent as a
          musician, I formed plenty of connections with like-minded people and I wish to create
          a platform for people to do the same. This is becoming ever more important in the ever more
          declining condition of the world.
